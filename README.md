# Just Dig
## A Custom Minecraft Game Mode

Just Dig is a custom minecraft game mode focused on world alteration. Users will start in an 8x8 world, and their borders will slowly expand the longer they survive. The core gameplay was designed to create a very fast, very rewarding feedback loop focused on providing users with a Minecraft experience like no other. 

This is a server side mod, intended for small groups of players - It was tested on the PaperMC server software. 

## Features
- Elastic world border that shrinks and expands
- A "World Level" that ranks up based on total blocks broken
  - Each level up to the "world level" yields items to help the player progress
  - Each world level up also expands the world borders. The more you dig, the bigger your world gets
- A randomization system that drops one new item from the sky every 10 minutes
  - Randomization aids with a more accelerated pacing to the game, so players can get items outside of their biome
  - It also provides a hook to keep players engaged "Just one more drop..." 
- A collection of custom items built to enhance the core game mechanics
  - See custom items section below
- A shop where users can spend their rare drops on custom items to help them
